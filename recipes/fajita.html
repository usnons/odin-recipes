<p> The chicken for these chicken fajita tacos marinates overnight, so youâ€™ll need to plan ahead, but when it comes to preparing dinner, your tacos will be ready in under 30 minutes. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mild taco seasoning (see Note)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
    <li>1/2 onion, cut into strips</li>
    <li>1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
    <li>1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
    <li>8 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1 avocado, pitted and sliced, or as needed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream, or as needed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup crumbled cotija cheese, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
