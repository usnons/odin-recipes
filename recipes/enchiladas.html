<p> This chicken enchilada casserole recipe is so good that my four picky kids eat it â€” and I got my picture in the paper for it! If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas into quarters so they absorb the sauce better.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
    <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. </li>
    <li> Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Cool, shred, and set aside. </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner using metal tongs until lightly puffed, about 1 minute. </li>
    <li> Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the bottom of a medium baking dish; arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer on top. </li>
    <li> Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce. </li>
    <li> Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining enchilada sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with any remaining enchilada sauce. </li>
    <li> Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving. </li>
